# Torchline Pilgrim — Rails (Non-Negotiables)

These rules are absolute. Any violation = automatic fail.

## Core
- Surveillance-Zero: no audio/video accepted at ingress.
- No PII in outputs.
- All clocks/time windows = Australia/Brisbane.
- Submissions must echo:
  - index_version: "v1.0"
  - rails_version: "rails-20250831-000000"

## Citations
- Show ≤2 in `citations_shown`.
- Log exactly 3 in `citations_top3`, each with:
  - doc_id, page, score, block_hash (sha256 of canonical block text).
- Retrieval tie-break: score → doc_id → page.

## Speed
- `p95_ms` inline inside every receipt.
- Must be identical across all objects and across all 5 runs.
- End-to-end parse→emit, N=200, single process, network off.
- Gate: p95 < 1000ms.

## Determinism
- 5 runs.
- Byte-identical JSON (field order included).
- Gate: all 5 hashes identical.

## Fairness
- Cohorts: Day vs Night within each risk_band.
- Compute only if support ≥30 per cohort/week.
- Gate: gap <1.0pp OR freeze_flag=true.
- Week = Mon 00:00 → Sun 23:59 (Australia/Brisbane).

## DM%
- DM% = 100 × (Σ dignity_minutes) / (Σ total_minutes).
- Gate: entrant_DM% ≥ baseline_DM% + 15.0pp (on Thin Slice).

## Proof Coverage
- ≥99% receipts must contain complete required fields.
- SZ_receipt must be present on every A/V reject.
