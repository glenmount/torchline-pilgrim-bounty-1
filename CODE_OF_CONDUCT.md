Torchline Pilgrim Bounty 1 — Code of Conduct

This repository and community spaces (GitHub, Discord/Slack, public threads) exist to run the Torchline Pilgrim Quest fairly and safely. By participating, you agree to the following:

1. Surveillance-Zero

No audio or video streams. No cameras, no microphones, no screenshots of people.

Object-level events only (e.g., “bed-exit”, motion counts).

2. Receipts-First

Every claim must be backed by receipts, not streams: logs, hashes, citations.

Messages show ≤2 citations; logs must keep top-3 with doc_id, page, block_hash, and index_version.

3. Determinism & Fairness

Same inputs → byte-identical outputs across 5 runs.

p95 < 1.0s on the provided doc pack.

Equal-risk → equal-action; if the fairness gap ≥1.0 percentage point, you must freeze learning/policy changes until fixed.

4. Respect & Collaboration

Be concise, respectful, and receipts-first in Discussions/Slack.

No harassment, trolling, or personal attacks.

No posting of personal information (PII).

5. Enforcement

Breaking these rules may result in removal from the bounty, disqualification from prizes, or deletion of posts.
The organiser (maintainer of this repo) is the final arbiter of disputes.

Remember: Fast help, no spying. Labels-in → cited action-out, backed by receipts any auditor can replay.
