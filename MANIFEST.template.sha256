Hash‑Chained Manifest (Template)
List each artifact and its SHA‑256. Keep filenames stable; update the hash when content changes. Include this file at submission.

# Artifact → SHA-256
docs/guidelines_index_v1.pdf — [sha256]
docs/policy_notes_v1.pdf    — [sha256]
samples/sample_input.json   — [sha256]

# Your outputs (example)
outputs/nudge_example.json  — [sha256]
logs/audit_top3.json        — [sha256]
logs/fairness_report.json   — [sha256]
logs/run_output_hash.txt    — [sha256]

# Versioning
meta/index_version.txt      — [sha256]   # contains the string you used as index_version
meta/block_chain.log        — [sha256]   # your hash chain file if you keep one


How we use this
We verify file integrity, replay your outputs, and confirm your logs match the declared index_version and block_hash chain.
